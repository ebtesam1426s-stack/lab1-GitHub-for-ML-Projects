Hi, I am Ebtisam Al-Shahri!

I am currently a third-year student majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am passionate about technology and interested in how machine learning and AI can be applied to solve real-world problems. Through my studies, I aim to develop strong skills in programming, data analysis, and intelligent systems.

Looking forward to learning more about machine learning in ARTI 308!
